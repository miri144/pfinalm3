               I am a second year graduate student in the Dual PhD/JD program in Developmental
               Psychology and Law between the Department of Human Development and the Law School.
               I am interested in the psychology of stigma, prejudice, stereotype threat, and group
               differences, along with the potential mitigating role of sense of purpose in life,
               and how these areas of psychology intersect with the legal topics of civil rights law,
               labor law, education law, and trial biases.  Outside of academia I enjoy exploring the
               gorges and natural wonders around Ithaca, going to concerts and sporting events, and
               learning to embrace this strange and alien concept that the locals here call seasons.
